# Maze-Game-in-C-Windows-Console-
This project is a simple **maze exploration game** written in C.   It generates random mazes using the **Aldous-Broder algorithm**, and the player can move around with **keyboard controls**.   The maze is rendered in the Windows console, and the program tracks **FPS, delta time, and player levels**.
